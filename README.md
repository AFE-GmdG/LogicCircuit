# LogicCircuit

A logical circuit simulator based on
[Logic Circuit](http://www.logiccircuit.org/)
from [Eugene Lepekhin](mailto://eugene.lepekhin@gmail.com)
but in typescript to work direct from web.

Look at the [Current Version](https://a-friedel.github.io/LogicCircuit/).

This project is a proof-of-concept and may not work at all.

A nice state manager library [easm](https://github.com/dotnetautor/easm)
from Matthias Fischer is used, thanks for his work.
